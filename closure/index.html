        <h1>Closure</h1>
<p>Its like remember something</p>
<p>
    A closure is a programming concept in which a function has access to its surrounding state, including variables and functions that are outside of its own scope. The main advantage of using closures in programming are:
</p>
<p>Data Privacy: Closures help in creating private variables and methods that are not accessible from outside the function. This allows for better data privacy and helps to prevent accidental modification of the state of the function from external sources.</p>

<p>Function Factories: Closures can be used to create functions on the fly that are specific to a certain context or state. This can be useful in creating function factories that return functions tailored to a specific need.</p>

<p>Memory Efficiency: Closures can help reduce memory usage by allowing the reuse of functions and variables in a program. This can help optimize code and reduce the overall memory footprint of the application.</p>

<p>Callbacks: Closures are frequently used in callback functions, which are functions that are passed as arguments to other functions. By using closures, the callback function can maintain its own state and data, which can be useful in certain programming situations.</p>

<p>Overall, closures can be a powerful tool in programming, allowing for increased flexibility, data privacy, and memory efficiency.
